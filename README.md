# Malaria-classification-using-deep-learning-
The project consists of automated image based malaria detection system using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model classifies microscopic blood smear images into two categories:
Parasitized and Uninfected.
The objective is to support faster and more reliable diagnosis in clinical and resource-limited settings by utilizing deep learning.
Manual examination of blood slides is very time consuming operation and required the expertise of skilled professionals in the respective domains. 
By using CNN model this project evaluates visual data, identifying siginificant patterns, and forecast infection status with high precision. It also helped as digital AI based diagonistic and hence make it more relevant in healthcare practises and minimizing human errors.

# Features
1. Automated Image Classification
2. Efficient Preprocessing
3. Custom CNN Architecture
4. Performance Montioring
5. Model Training

# Working
1. Load Dataset:
Blood smear images are loaded from organized folders using TensorFlow’s directory-based dataset loader.

2. Preprocess Images:
Images are standardized and augmented to enhance training robustness.

3. Train the CNN:
The model learns to differentiate parasitized and uninfected cells through multiple training epochs.

4. Evaluate Performance:
Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score provide a detailed performance breakdown.

5. Predict New Images:
The trained model can classify new, unseen blood smear images.
