# Malaria-classification-using-deep-learning-
The project consists of automated image based malaria detection system using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model classifies microscopic blood smear images into two categories:
Parasitized and Uninfected.
The objective is to support faster and more reliable diagnosis in clinical and resource-limited settings by utilizing deep learning.
Manual examination of blood slides is very time consuming operation and required the expertise of skilled professionals in the respective domains. 
By using CNN model this project evaluates visual data, identifying siginificant patterns, and forecast infection status with high precision. It also helped as digital AI based diagonistic and hence make it more relevant in healthcare practises and minimizing human errors.
