# Malaria-classification-using-deep-learning- The project consists of automated image based malaria detection system using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model classifies microscopic blood smear images into two categories:
Parasitized
Uninfected
The objective is to support faster and more reliable diagnosis in clinical and resource-limited settings by leveraging deep learning.
