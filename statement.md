#Problem Statement: 
The microscopic study of diagnosis of malaria using blood smear slides required a high level of skill. In many rural areas we can found lot of cases where certain number of pathologists are unavailable. These cases then lead to delays in diagnosis or incorrect classifications. Also, the cells that have been infected can be misunderstood as uninfected cells, which makes it difficult to classify them accurately, even for experienced professionals. 
To overcome these issues, the project tries to create an automated deep learning model that can properly categorize cell pictures as either Parasitized or Uninfected. This approach is automated and it has the potential to reduce the workload of diagnostics and enhance the speed of early detection.

#Scope of the Project :
These are the main objectives of the Malaria Cell Classification project:
•	To build a CNN based classifier which is efficient and it can detect malaria infected cells in the given blood smear pictures.
•	To prepare a clean and standardized dataset in preprocessing so that it can be effective for the model training.
•	To train and validate the model by applying deep-learning techniques on real microscopic image data.
•	To evaluate the trained model using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.
